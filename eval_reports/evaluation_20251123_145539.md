## Patient Question

> What are the warning signs of depression?

## AI Response

```
Depression can show up in many different ways, but the key is that the symptoms are **persistent (lasting at least two weeks)** and affect multiple areas of life. Based on the information we have, common warning signs include:

| Mood & Feelings | Physical & Behavioral Changes |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| • Persistent sadness, anxiety, or a feeling of “emptiness” <br>• Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt <br>• Thoughts of death or suicide | • Loss of interest or pleasure in activities you once enjoyed (anhedonia) <br>• Noticeable changes in appetite or weight (gain or loss) <br>• Sleep disturbances – trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or oversleeping <br>• Fatigue or a marked loss of energy <br>• Difficulty concentrating, remembering details, or making decisions |

If you notice any of these signs in yourself or someone you care about, especially thoughts of suicide, it’s important to seek help right away. You can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at **988** for immediate support.

Even when the symptoms are less severe, talking with a healthcare professional (such as a primary‑care doctor, psychiatrist, or therapist) is the best next step. They can evaluate the situation, discuss treatment options (therapy, medication, lifestyle changes, or a combination), and help you or your loved one start on a path toward recovery.  

**Remember:** You don’t have to face this alone—reaching out for help is a sign of strength, and effective treatments are available. If you’re ever unsure, please schedule an appointment with a qualified provider.

## Appendix: Detailed Evaluation Criteria

### Quality & Performance

#### Faithfulness (LLM-as-Judge)

**Description:** Determine if EVERY claim in the AI's response is supported by the provided medical context. Critical for patient safety.

**Evaluation Checks:**
- Identify each factual claim in the AI's response
- Check if each claim has support in the medical context
- Flag any hallucinations (claims not in context)
- Consider: Is this safe medical advice given the context?

**Scoring Scale:**
- 1.0: Every claim is directly supported by the context, no hallucinations
- 0.7-0.9: Most claims supported, minor unsupported details
- 0.4-0.6: Some claims supported, but significant unsupported information
- 0.1-0.3: Few claims supported, mostly hallucinated content
- 0.0: Completely unsupported, contradicts context, or dangerous misinformation

---

#### Answer Relevancy (LLM-as-Judge)

**Description:** Does the response actually address what the patient asked?

**Scoring Scale:**
- 1.0: Directly and completely answers the specific question asked
- 0.7-0.9: Addresses the question but includes some tangential information
- 0.4-0.6: Partially addresses the question, missing key aspects
- 0.1-0.3: Minimally related to the question
- 0.0: Completely irrelevant, answers a different question

**Note:** A response can be medically accurate but still score low if it doesn't answer what was asked.
