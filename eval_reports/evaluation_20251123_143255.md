## Patient Question

> What are the warning signs of depression?

## AI Response

```
Depression can show up in many different ways, but the key warning signs are the symptoms that persist for **at least two weeks** and affect daily life. According to the information provided, common signs include:

- **Persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” mood** – feeling down or hopeless most of the day, nearly every day.  
- **Loss of interest or pleasure** in activities you once enjoyed (sometimes called anhedonia).  
- **Changes in appetite or weight** – either eating much more or much less, leading to noticeable weight gain or loss.  
- **Sleep disturbances** – trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping far too much.  
- **Fatigue or loss of energy** – feeling constantly tired even after rest.  
- **Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt** – harsh self‑criticism or feeling you’re a burden.  
- **Difficulty concentrating or making decisions** – trouble focusing, remembering, or choosing even simple things.  
- **Thoughts of death or suicide** – recurrent thoughts about dying, self‑harm, or a plan to end your life.

If you notice several of these symptoms lasting for two weeks or more, it’s important to reach out for help. Depression is treatable, and early intervention can make a big difference.

**Next steps**

- **Talk to a healthcare professional** (your primary care doctor, psychiatrist, or therapist) for a proper evaluation and to discuss treatment options such as psychotherapy, medication, or a combination of both.  
- **If you ever have thoughts of suicide or self‑harm**, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at **988** right away or go to your nearest emergency department.

You don’t have to face this alone—support is available, and recovery is possible with the right care.
